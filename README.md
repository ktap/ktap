A New Scripting Dynamic Tracing Tool For Linux  
[www.ktap.org][homepage]

ktap is a new scripting dynamic tracing tool for Linux,
it uses a scripting language and lets users trace the Linux kernel dynamically.
ktap is designed to give operational insights with interoperability
that allows users to tune, troubleshoot and extend kernel and application.
It's similar with Linux Systemtap and Solaris Dtrace.

ktap have different design principles from Linux mainstream dynamic tracing
language in that it's based on bytecode, so it doesn't depend upon GCC,
doesn't require compiling kernel module for each script, safe to use in
production environment, fulfilling the embedded ecosystem's tracing needs.

More information can be found at [ktap homepage][homepage].

## Highlights

  * simple but powerful scripting language
  * register based interpreter (heavily optimized) in Linux kernel
  * small and lightweight (6KLOC of interpreter)
  * not depend on gcc for each script running
  * easy to use in embedded environment without debugging info
  * support for tracepoint, kprobe, uprobe, function trace, timer, and more
  * supported in x86, arm, ppc, mips
  * safety in sandbox

## Building & Running

1. Clone ktap from github

        $ git clone http://github.com/ktap/ktap.git

2. Compiling ktap

        $ cd ktap
        $ make       #generate ktapvm kernel module and ktap binary

3. Load ktapvm kernel module(make sure debugfs mounted)

        $ make load  #need to be root or have sudo access

4. Running ktap

        $ ./ktap samples/helloworld.kp


## Examples

1. simplest one-liner command to enable all tracepoints

        ktap -e "trace *:* { print(argevent) }"

2. syscall tracing on target process

        ktap -e "trace syscalls:* { print(argevent) }" -- ls

3. ftrace(kernel newer than 3.3, and must compiled with CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER)

        ktap -e "trace ftrace:function { print(argevent) }"

        ktap -e "trace ftrace:function /ip==mutex*/ { print(argevent) }"

4. simple syscall tracing

        trace syscalls:* {
                print(cpu(), pid(), execname(), argevent)
        }

5. syscall tracing in histogram style

        local s = {}

        trace syscalls:sys_enter_* {
                s[argname] += 1
        }

        trace_end {
                histogram(s)
        }

6. kprobe tracing

        trace probe:do_sys_open dfd=%di fname=%dx flags=%cx mode=+4($stack) {
                print("entry:", execname(), argevent)
        }

        trace probe:do_sys_open%return fd=$retval {
                print("exit:", execname(), argevent)
        }

7. uprobe tracing

        trace probe:/lib/libc.so.6:malloc {
                print("entry:", execname(), argevent)
        }

        trace probe:/lib/libc.so.6:malloc%return {
                print("exit:", execname(), argevent)
        }

8. stapsdt tracing (userspace static marker)

        trace sdt:/lib64/libc.so.6:lll_futex_wake {
                print("lll_futex_wake", execname(), argevent)
        }

        or:

        #trace all static mark in libc
        trace sdt:/lib64/libc.so.6:* {
                print(execname(), argevent)
        }

9. timer

        tick-1ms {
                printf("time fired on one cpu\n");
        }

        profile-2s {
                printf("time fired on every cpu\n");
        }

10. FFI (Call kernel function from ktap script, need to compile with FFI=1)

        ffi.cdef[[
                int printk(char *fmt, ...);
        ]]

        ffi.C.printk("This message is called from ktap ffi\n")
